# Permissions audit — 2026-05-17

Full role × resource matrix for the app. Read this **before** adding new
endpoints, components, or sensitive data, so the new code follows the
existing tier conventions and you don't accidentally leak admin data.

---

## 1. The four roles

| Role | What they are | Backend test |
|---|---|---|
| **Team Member** | Default. Sees their own data + everyone's operational/task data. | `not is_manager_or_above(user)` |
| **Manager-tier** | Manager, Shift Lead, Director, Admin (role names). Runs the floor + handles operations. | `is_manager_or_above(user)` |
| **Admin** | `role='admin'` OR `user.is_admin=True`. Owns store configuration + sensitive HR docs. | `is_admin_or_above(user)` |
| **Superuser** | Django `is_superuser=True`. Cross-store, full bypass. | `user.is_superuser` |

Note: "Director" and "Admin" both sit in `MANAGER_ROLES`; `is_admin_or_above`
is stricter and checks for the admin role / flag / superuser.

Frontend helpers (`frontend/src/utils/access.js`):
- `isManagerOrAbove(user)` — for manager-tier UI gates
- `isAdminOrAbove(user)` — for admin-tier UI gates (Operator Overview, etc.)

## 3. Specific rules worth remembering

**Multi-tenancy.** Every operational model has a `store` FK, and every
`StoreScopedViewSet` auto-filters by `request.user.store` and auto-stamps
`store=request.user.store` on create. A manager in Store A literally
**cannot** see Store B's tasks even with a crafted request.

**Per-user data isolation:**
- `/leadership/development-plans/` returns ONLY the requesting user's
  enrollments (managers DO NOT see other users' plans through this list).
  Team progress is a separate endpoint (`team_progress/`) that's
  manager-gated.
- `/notifications/` returns ONLY the requesting user's rows, AND filters
  out `requires_manager=True` rows for team-member roles (so guest
  concerns/HR docs don't leak).
- `/users/me/preferences/` is always self-scoped.

**Sensitive notifications.** When server-side code creates a
`Notification`, set `requires_manager=True` for: guest concerns,
documentation/disciplinary docs, 360 evaluation results,
admin-only system alerts. Team members will not see these in their bell.

**Development plan assignments (the rule you asked for):** only
**admins and superusers** can assign a plan to another user. Manager-tier
roles can MONITOR progress (`Team Progress` panel) but cannot enroll a
team member. Enforced in `UserDevelopmentPlanViewSet.perform_create` via
`is_admin_or_above(requester)`. Frontend mirrors this with the
`canAssignPlans` gate in `LeadershipDevPlans.js`.

**Operator Overview / Weekly Digest.** Admin-tier only. The endpoint
returns 403 to non-admins server-side and the profile-dropdown link is
hidden in the UI via `isAdminOrAbove(user)`.

**User Management (`/users/`).** Admin-tier write. Even admins **cannot**
elevate someone to `is_admin` or `is_superuser` — only superusers can
toggle those flags. Enforced in `UserManagementViewSet` via
`CanManageUsers`.

**Career Path (4-card strip).** Read by everyone (subject to the
store's `dev_tracks_visible_to_team` toggle), but the edit drawer
requires admin-tier. Tracks themselves are STORE-WIDE configuration.

## 4. Quick reference: where to add a new permission gate

**Backend** — pick the right helper from `api/permissions.py`:

```python
# Read for all, write for managers (most common pattern)
permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, ReadAllWriteManager]

# Manager-tier on every action
permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsManagerOrAbove]

# Admin-tier on every action
permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsAdminOrAbove]

# Per-action overrides
def get_permissions(self):
    if self.action in {'complete', 'history'}:
        return [IsAuthenticated()]
    if self.action in {'destroy', 'mass_archive'}:
        return [IsAdminOrAbove()]
    return super().get_permissions()
```

**Frontend** — mirror it in JSX:

```jsx
import { isManagerOrAbove, isAdminOrAbove } from '../utils/access';

const canManage = isManagerOrAbove(user);
const canAdmin  = isAdminOrAbove(user);

// Hide the action entirely (preferred over disabled)
{canManage && <button onClick={openCreate}>Create</button>}
// Disabled state for actions a team member sees but can't perform
<button disabled={!canManage}>Edit</button>
```

## 5. Known gaps / TODO

- **Task #48 (still open):** Separate demo + test users into different
  stores so cross-tenant isolation can be smoke-tested in production.
- **Chat reactions** (heart/thumbs/pin per LD Growth screenshot): model +
  endpoints not yet built. Will need its own ChatMessageReaction model
  with `IsAuthenticated` for create + same-author-or-manager for delete.
- **Documentation Preferences drawer** (per `/team-documentation`
  Settings gear): UI spec captured; backend uses
  `StoreSettings.documentation_prefs` JSONField (not yet added).
- **Pending Acknowledgment** flow on employee records (Operator Overview
  surfaces the count, but there's no UI for an employee to actually
  acknowledge a record yet).
- **360 Take Evaluation / Results view**: backend `respond()` action
  exists; the rating UI is still a sentinel modal.

When any of these ships, update this matrix.
